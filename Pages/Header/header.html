<h2>Ferrari. The man, the legend!</h2>

<p>
Enzo Ferrari, born in 1898 in Modena, Italy, was a passionate racing enthusiast who founded Scuderia Ferrari 
in 1929 as a racing team for Alfa Romeo. In 1947, after parting ways with Alfa Romeo, he established 
Ferrari S.p.A. and introduced the first Ferrari-badged car, the 125 S, powered by a V12 engine—a symbol 
of Ferrari's engineering brilliance and dedication to performance.

Ferrari quickly gained fame for its dominance in motorsport, particularly in Formula One, becoming the most 
successful team in the sport’s history. Over the decades, the company also evolved into a luxury carmaker, 
crafting high-performance road cars that combined cutting-edge technology with Italian artistry.

Today, Ferrari remains one of the most prestigious car brands in the world, with its headquarters in Maranello, 
Italy. It continues to innovate in both motorsport and luxury vehicles, integrating hybrid technology with models
such as the SF90 Stradale and embracing sustainability while preserving its tradition of excellence. 
Beyond cars, Ferrari has expanded its global influence with iconic museums. The Museo Ferrari in Maranello 
celebrates the company’s history in motorsport and engineering, while the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena offers 
an in-depth look at the founder’s life and the origins of the Ferrari legacy.

Ferrari’s legacy is defined by its relentless pursuit of speed, innovation, and style, epitomising the 
pinnacle of automotive excellence and inspiring a global passion for high-performance cars. Its museums 
attract enthusiasts from around the world, serving as a testament to its cultural and automotive impact
